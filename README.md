Certainly! Step 4 involves setting up Alembic for database migrations. Follow these steps:

### Step 4: Set Up Alembic for Migrations

1. **Install Alembic**:

   If you haven't already, install Alembic using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install alembic
   ```

2. **Initialize Alembic**:

   To set up Alembic for your project, navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   ```

   This will create an `alembic` directory in your project with the necessary files for managing migrations.

3. **Edit `alembic.ini`**:

   Open the `alembic.ini` file in the `alembic` directory. You'll need to configure it to connect to your database. Modify the `[alembic]` section to specify the database URL. Update the `sqlalchemy.url` value:

   ```ini
   sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///todo.db  # Replace with your actual database URL
   ```

4. **Create the First Migration**:

   After configuring `alembic.ini`, you can create the initial migration for your current database schema. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   alembic revision -m "initial"
   ```

   This will create a new migration script in the `versions` directory with the changes detected in your models. You can customize the migration script to include additional details if needed.

5. **Review and Modify the Migration**:

   Open the generated migration script inside the `versions` directory. The script will contain `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions. Make sure it correctly represents the changes you want to apply to the database.

6. **Apply Migrations**:

   To apply the migrations and update your database schema, run:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

   This command will execute all pending migrations and apply the changes to your database.

7. **Creating Future Migrations**:

   Whenever you make changes to your models or database schema, generate a new migration by running:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of the changes"
   ```

   This will create a new migration script in the `versions` directory based on the changes you made to your models. You can then review and apply the new migration using `alembic upgrade head`.

With these steps, you have set up Alembic for managing database migrations in your project. Alembic will keep track of changes to your database schema, making it easier to evolve your application over time.

Yes, you can delete the `todo.db` file and then run the initial migration using Alembic. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Delete the Database File**:
   
   Delete the `todo.db` file from your project directory.

2. **Create the Initial Migration**:
   
   Run the following command to create the initial migration:

   ```bash
   alembic revision -m "initial"
   ```

   This will create a new migration script in the `versions` directory based on your current models.

3. **Apply the Initial Migration**:
   
   Apply the initial migration to create the database and set up the initial schema:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

   This command will create a new `todo.db` file and set up the initial schema based on the migration.

By following these steps, you will recreate the `todo.db` file and apply the initial migration to set up your database and schema.
